# Analysis of Immunosenescence on Epidemic and Vaccine Modeling 
  Varying factors can contribute to susceptibility to disease among populations. One particular factor to consider is age and the development of immunosenescence. Immunosenescence is the alteration of immune function, typically thymic involution causing the decreased functions of T and B cells, due to aging (Rink & Wessels, 2022). Both of these cell types are involved in the acquisition or antigen-specific immune response such that they are the only cells in an organism that can recognize and respond to that specific antigen epitope (Cano & Lopera, 2013). In immunosenescence the number of memory T and B cells increase, while the response to new antigens decreases. Similarly, this decreases the function of granulocytes, macrophages, and NK cells (Rink & Wessels, 2022). 
  The importance of immunosenescence and aging was especially emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Increased susceptibility to disease due to immunosenescence could play a huge role in the way mathematical and computational methods model disease and immunity as provided by vaccinations. This project seeks to explore how immunosenescence can be mathematically modeled using an SEIRS model, and how this idea can be applied to vaccination models.
